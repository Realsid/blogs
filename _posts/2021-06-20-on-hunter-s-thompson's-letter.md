>What is a meaningful life ?

>How to choose a goal that gives me purpose and meaning ?

Hunter S Thompson is a person worth doing a lengthy character study on. It is difficult to say what he is remembered for the most, his contribution to the literary world in the form of Gonzo journalism or his radical way of living. In this piece I want to talk about a [letter](https://fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/) that he wrote to a young friend of his who asked for life advice.

The letter starts with a disclaimer saying that asking for advice for "life goal" is very dangerous as you might be surrendering to the egomania of the man who you are asking. And because each man has his own take on life, to presume that one thing that worked for one is going to apply to another is an egomania disguised as charity. Thus, during the entire passage Hunter S Thompson tries to steer clear of giving and concrete direction rather invokes certain thoughts that if deeply pondered upon by the reader may reinvigorate him to search for his own.

The author argues, and should I say very correctly, that in life we have only two courses of action, that is, to float along the current of uncertainty or swim against it in pursuit of a goal. By using floating in the current as metaphor he sheds light on circumstances where a person has the least control over the outcome, where a person has blissfully surrendered to the will of the unknown. What else is to be noted is that the current is always there. If you're not swimming against it, you're swimming with it. This current might take you to places that might lead you to curse your misfortune or bless the serendipity. On the other hand, struggling with the current of uncertainty is not a pretty process. It's vicious and arduous. It takes a toll on you physically and mentally. To top it all, the current in your stream might overwhelm your every attempt to reach whatever small island that you are aiming to reach.The choice of swimming against the flow towards a goal is taken up first for examination since it seems like the reader was already going with the flow but rather not happy about it.

A person is a product of the reaction to his environment. As the environment is ever changing the perception of the person also keeps evolving. The author questions the idea of having a goal and centering your ever changing being around that goal. We have an idea of a goal and certain steps and demands that need to be fulfilled to achieve it. These demands often induce changes in a person. The demands come first and the person/being later. With ever changing perspective of a person, the goal (an idea) changes too and so do the demands. 

The author asks, wouldn't adjusting yourself to an idea that is a product of your current self leave you unfulfilled since you are changing from one moment to another. The self that set the goal no longer exists and the self that exists is not in harmony with the goal that was set. This cycle only produces anxiety and fatigue in a person.

Going by negation he says the answer then does not lie in finding goals or at least tangible ones. One might wonder what an intangible goal is? In the process of doing so he also reveals that he does not believe in god to deliver this answer as well and that the question pokes at very fundamentals of philosophy, which one could not summarize in two paragraphs.

He also introduces existentialism as key to the answer but wants the reader to not indulge if the reader is satisfied with their own self. But this leaves me wondering why this tease and word of caution ? I have not read any of the works suggested by the author but perhaps those works reveal more than the answer, that would send the reader into yet another quest far greater than the urgent matter at hand or it could be that these works are open to subjective interpretation which will render more room for confusion.

The author adds that according to him one should not strive to mold themselves to an idea but to strive to be ‘OURSELVES’ and mold our goals according to us.That sure fits the requirement of intangible goal. The idea of striving to be ourselves is very enticing. It at the same time looks very simple yet very complex. What does it mean to strive to be ‘OURSELVES’ ? Is my real self shrouded by my way of living and narrow perception ? Is there something within me that I am looking in the external ? This is the quest that the reader must take on.

The author I think was aware that these abstractions without any framework will leave the reader unfulfilled. He adds that every man has some ingrained desires and abilities including a need to live a meaningful life. I want to add that I think this 'every man' is actually a subset of people who have had the lower structure of Maslow's hierarchy of needs fulfilled .

The author gives a framework of sorts to find cross section of one's abilities and  desires that fulfills the following

1. Gives identity to the reader, 
2. Puts him on path of self development and saves one from wasting their potential
3. And finally shelters them from being disenchanted from the goals they had set. Given that they had set the goals to conform their being and not vice versa

This way the person has  has not dedicated the life to a predefined goal but has chosen a way of life he knows he will enjoy. He has the goals conformed to his lifestyle and he has chosen this for himself. 

The author adds that it is the readers responsibility to find the path and it is not an easy one. Where does one even begin looking ? Anyone asking a question how to live the life almost certainly has lived a narrow life, "a vertical rather horizontal existence". A narrow life is that of conformity. A vertical life where the path has already been decided and difficult choices have been made by someone outside of you. A horizontal existence on the other hand is akin to being at a buffet. An assortment of experiences of different sort that contributes to more wider perspective. Horizontal existence also comes with impermanence and constant change, not necessarily good all the times. 

He further cautions that a man who delays in the choosing will inevitably have the choice made for him by circumstances. And this brings us to our choice of going with the flow. He also warns against lamenting and regretting. If the reader ends up doing something that he doesn't like doing as a result of circumstances then they must convince themselves that there was no other choice. The reader will find many who have convinced themselves of the same.

The last lines are really hard to digest. In all walks of life there are those who have accepted to go with the flow. Their number is far greater than those who swim against the flow. It is about the nature of making choice and not regretting the choice. It also holds a heavy truth, not most find what they are looking for and must go with the flow.

It seems to me that both the options are always open to us. Both have bliss and blisters in their own way. It comes down to knowing what we want and who we are. The quest starts there.
